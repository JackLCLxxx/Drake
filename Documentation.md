# Project Description:
  Title: E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis
  
  Objective: "Analyze sales data to identify top-performing products, high-revenue regions, and seasonal sales trends."
  
  Tools: Google Sheets, Excel, Power BI (or similar for data visualization).

# Steps for Analysis:
  
  Step 1: Data Cleaning
    
    Remove duplicates and handle missing values in all datasets.
    
    Ensure consistency in key columns for joining datasets (e.g., item_key, store_key).
  Step 2: Data Integration
    
    Join datasets using key columns:
      
      Fact Table with Item Dimension on item_key.
      
      Fact Table with Store Dimension on store_key.
      
      Fact Table with Time Dimension on time_key.
   
    Create a unified dataset for analysis.

  Step 3: Analysis by Question
    
    Question 1: Top-Performing Products
      
      Aggregate total_price by item_name to calculate revenue per product.
      
      Sort in descending order to identify top-performing products.
    
    Question 2: Revenue by Region
      
      Aggregate total_price by upazila (or higher-level regions like division) to calculate regional revenue.
      
      Visualize the results with a bar or pie chart.
    
    Question 3: Monthly Sales Trends
      
      Extract month and year from the Time Dimension.
      
      Aggregate total_price by month to find monthly sales trends.
      
      Use a line chart for visualization.

# Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Top 5 products by revenue.

Pie Chart: Revenue distribution by region.

Line Chart: Monthly sales trends over a year.

Data Cleaning

1. Observation and Method

  Observation: Identified placeholder names such as - and ???? in the name column of the customer_dim dataset.

  Method: Used Excel Filter to filter rows in the name column containing - or ????.

2. Potential Issues with This Observation

  Placeholder names do not provide meaningful customer identification, which could impact interpretability.

  These customers had valid coustomer_key and significant purchase activity, making their records important for analysis.

  Placeholder entries might confuse stakeholders when reviewing the dataset.

3. Reason for This Observation

  Placeholder names like - or ???? are likely due to incomplete data entry during customer registration or transaction logging.

  Despite placeholder names, the presence of unique coustomer_key and high-value transactions suggests these are valid customers.

4. Solution and Reason for the Solution

  Solution: Replaced all placeholder names (- and ????) with "Unknown Customer".

  How: Used Excelâ€™s Find and Replace feature to update these entries.

  Ensured that these customers are still identifiable through their unique coustomer_key.

Reason for the Solution:
  Retains the integrity of transaction data for high-value customers.

  Avoids misrepresentation of these entries as invalid or excluded data.

  Standardizes placeholder names, improving readability and clarity for stakeholders.
